I am currently a PhD student at the University of Connecticut in the [Institute for System Genomics](https://isg.uconn.edu) and [Marine Sciences](https://marinesciences.uconn.edu). I work with [Dr. Hannes Baumann](https://befel.marinesciences.uconn.edu). We are currently leveraging novel genomic approaches to gain a mechanistic understanding of organismal response to climate change. I am particularly interested in low-coverage, whole genome sequencing approaches and bioinformatic tools to process large data sets which will help us better understand how organisms will deal with environmental stressors.

In my free time, I love to sail.
