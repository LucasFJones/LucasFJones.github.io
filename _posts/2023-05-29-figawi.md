title: Figawi sailtrip

Figawi Race, Memorial Day Weekend 2023. A solid crew sailed from Stonington to Hyannis to join in on the Figawi Race. Afterwards, I took the SD card from our chart plotter to analyze our course and speed! I wrote an algorith that takes our GPS coordinates and time, and calculates speed. This was all done in R, I can share the script if you want to do something similar.
