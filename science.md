I love coding and bioinformatics work! Check out some of the papers I have worked on by going to my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-LWv2HMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).

Here is my [masters thesis](https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/80/1/122/6872753). This work used whole genome sequences to look at population structure of an important forage fish in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean.

For my PhD, I am using whole genome sequencing to look at larvae exposed to ocean acidification scenarios. From this, we can try to find the genomic basis of organisms who are sensitive to climate change.
